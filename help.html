                </font>
                Aurora (formerly BaSTPC) is an alternative STiBaRC client created by Studio Verso. STiBaRC and Aurora are very similar in features, but the design of Aurora is drastically different than STiBaRC. If you are lost or confused on how to use Aurora, Studio Verso has provided some help topics for you below.<br>
                <br><font size="5"><b>REGISTER AND SIGN IN</b></font><br><br>
                LOGIN
                <br>
                <br>
                To use Aurora, you must sign in with your STiBaRC account. Click/tap the "Log in" button on the top of the screen. A new window will open prompting if you accept Aurora to access your STiBaRC account. Click/tap "Login" on the STiBaRC window. If you are not logged in, the window will redirect you to the login page. Once you are logged in with your STiBaRC account, you can try to log in to Aurora again with your logged in STiBaRC account.

                    <b>CREATE A NEW POST</b><br><br>
                </font>
                To create a new post, go to the top of the screen and then click/tap "New Post". To create a new post, you must give it a title and content. Blank titles and HTML code are not accepted. Optionally, you can attach one image, video or audio file on your post. Larger files will take longer to upload. If your browser says that Aurora has froze while uploading an image, click/tap "wait" until it is done uploading. Once you are done creating your post, click/tap "CREATE POST".

                COMMENTS<br>
                <br>
                All registered users can comment on posts shared on Aurora and other clients. To view comments on a post, click/tap your desired post. Scroll down to the "Comments" section to view comments. Under a comment is a "reply" button which can be used to reply to the user who commented. If you wish to not use this feature, continue to scroll until you see the "New comment" section. Type out your comment in the box and click/tap "SUBMIT" to share your comment.<br>
                <br>POLLS<br>
                <br>
                Registered users can use the poll system on a post. On each post, there are two arrows (⇧⇩). The up arrow (⇧) means someone likes this post. The down arrow (⇩) means that someone dislikes your post. To use the poll system, go to any post and click/tap the arrows of your choice. You can always change your poll vote on any post.

                <font size="5"><b>EDITING A POST</b></font><br><br>
                <br>
                To edit a post, you most have the "donor" role on your profile. The donor role is given to a user when they donate to STiBaRC. If you have the donor role, you can edit any post you have shared. On your post, the "EDIT POST" button will be under the "VIEW ATTACHMENT" button. Note that you can only edit the title and content of the post. You cannot edit the attachment. When your edited post is shared, your post will have an "edited" tag under the title.
                <br>
                <br>
                <font size="5"><b>EDITING YOUR PROFILE</b></font><br><br>
                <br>
                To edit your profile, go to the top of the screen and then click/tap  your profile picture icon > Settings > My Account > Edit Profile. You can change your profile picture, name, email, birthday, and bio. Other profile options include requesting user verification. To change your STiBaRC account password, go to Settings > Securtiy & Privacy.
                <br>
                <br>
                    <font size="5"><b>USER VERIFICATION</b></font><br><br>
                <br>
                Verifed account users will have a checkmark (✔️ or ✔) next to their username on their profile and posts. Verified accounts help in seeing if the user is an official account of a person and not a fake one. To request verifcation for your account, go to Menu > Settings > My Account > Edit Profile > Request Account Verification.
